      The general goal of this app is to predict a player's Home Run total for the 2023 season.
      Home Runs are when a player scores themself on their own batted ball, which most often occurs when 
      the ball is hit over the fence within fair territory. Basic variables within the dataset 
      include a player's age, position, and league. Advanced variables include xSLG (expected 
      Slugging Percentage), Avg. Exit Velocity, and more. 
      
      The data source website, Baseball Savant, followed by a detailed glossary, are linked
      at the bottom of this tab."),

      will give more deatil abotu the two models we are using: a multiple linear regression model and
      random forest model. The Model Fitting tab will allow the user to input desired parameters that
      effect the models and their interpratation, such as the training/testing split and fit statisitcs,
      among others. Users can test prediction in the final subtab, Prediction, by entering values
      for coefficients of the fitted models."),
